# DesktopEmail
Sending and Receiving emails with different email boxes.


Hi guys,
This Project is DesktopEmail where you can
check your e-mail from different e-mail boxes.
Write E-mails edit it with using options.
You can preview how look like your
e-mail before send. That was my second program.
In my opinion if i have some E-mails with different
domains you must using browser and login in a lot
of webpages which is boring. Thanks it you can save
some time.
